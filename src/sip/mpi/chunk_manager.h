/**
 * This class maintains the set of Chunks for a single array.
 *
 * It owns and is responsible for allocating and deallocating chunk data arrays.
 *
 * A reference to the associated file is needed in order to obtain the rank and number of
 * procs in the file's communicator and to restore chunks when necessary to maintain certain
 * invariants.  The rank and number of servers are used for determining the file offsets, which allow
 * a chunk-sized region of the file to be exclusively associated with a particular chunk.
 *
 * The memory for an array is allocated in units of a Chunk.  Blocks are
 * assigned space in a chunk, with new chunks created as needed.
 *
 * Invariant:  All blocks belonging to a chunk have valid data
 * in memory or the chunk's data pointer is NULL.
 *
 * Invariant:  If the chunk's data pointer is NULL, then the data has been
 * backed up on disk and the chunk's valid_on_disk flag is set.  (A chunk
 * may be valid_on_disk and valid in memory at the same time)
