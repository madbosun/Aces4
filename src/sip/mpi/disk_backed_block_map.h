/**
 * Wrapper over block map for servers.
 * Supports backing on disk
 *
 * This class is responsible for maintaining the measures of remaining memory, and
 * for updating the status of individual blocks as they are modified, written and read from
 * disks, etc.
 *
 * All block-sized memory allocation including, for example, temp buffers for asynchronous
 * ops, should happen via this class.
 *
 * Invariants:  each distributed/served array has exactly one open file associated with it,
 * whose ArrayFile object is in the array_files_ vector.  The ArrayFile objects are created
 * in this classe's constructor (which opens the file) and destroyed (which closes and
 * possibly deletes the file) in this class's destructor.  The ArrayFile object is replaced
 * with a new one, and the old one destroyed, when an array is restored.
